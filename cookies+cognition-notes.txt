ID = subject ID
TP-Date is which session the receipt was submitted for
RecNum = a receipt id for that subject on that session
Item (modifier) = the item â€“ parentheses are extra details 

Does quantity purchased matter? 
Should purchase frequency be normalized by perishability?

Intrinsic representation in grocery shopping is reflected in grocery stores organizing items by food categories like diary, meats, grains. Prepared foods, snacks, and desserts can be considered fully intrinsic.

Extrinic representation in grocery shopping is reflected in cooking recipes. Grocery stores place a small rack of hamburger buns near the meat section, despite most of the buns beings stored near the grains.

A fully intrinsic representation might look like someone shopping entirely from story categories, like only diary. A fully extrinsic representation might look like someone shopping entirely by recipe.

Can changes in shopping behavior like forgetting regular items (extrinic representation) or becoming distracted and picking up new items (intrinsic representation) be mined from time series data. Can it predict cognitive decline?
